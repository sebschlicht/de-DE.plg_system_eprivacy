# plg_system_eprivacy

This is a fork of an EU ePrivacy directive package for *Joomla!* which extends the original plugin by German language files.

The plugin (as part of the package) prompts website visitors to either accept or decline cookies.
The usage of cookies and likewise data storage methods (Local/SessionStorage) will be prohibited until the user accepts their usage.
In combination with the package this covers HTTP-Cookies, JavaScript-Cookies and those by third-party extensions and scripts.

This fork enables automatic switching between English and German based on the user's preferred content language.
Besides, the fork simplifies further localization and aims to increase the overall code quality.

Keep in mind that this is only the system plugin.
The whole package contains the system plugin plus an AJAX plugin and a module.

## Installation

1. Download and install the latest EU ePrivacy directive package.
1. Then download and install the latest [system plugin localization package](https://github.com/sebschlicht/plg_system_eprivacy/releases).

Don't forget to activate the plugins and place the module on all pages.

## Compatibility

Just like the original plugin, the fork is compatible with *Joomla!* 3.
