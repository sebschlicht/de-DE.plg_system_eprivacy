# plg_system_eprivacy

This is a fork of the system plugin from *RicheyWeb*'s [EU ePrivacy directive package](https://www.richeyweb.com/software/joomla/packages/9-eu-e-privacy-directive) for *Joomla!* which extends the original plugin by German language files.  
Thus this fork allows for an automatic plugin translation into German, based on the user's preferred content language.

Besides, the fork simplifies further localization and aims to increase the overall code quality.

Keep in mind that this is only the system plugin.
Richey Web offers a whole package containing the system plugin plus an AJAX plugin and a module.

## Installation

1. Download and install the latest [EU ePrivacy directive package](https://www.richeyweb.com/software/joomla/packages/9-eu-e-privacy-directive) from *RicheyWeb*.
1. Then download and install the latest [localized system plugin](https://github.com/sebschlicht/plg_system_eprivacy/releases).

## Compatibility

Just like the original plugin, the fork is compatible with *Joomla!* 3.
