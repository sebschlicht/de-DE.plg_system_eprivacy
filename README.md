# plg_system_eprivacy

This is a German localization package of the system plugin from *RicheyWeb*'s [EU ePrivacy directive package](https://www.richeyweb.com/software/joomla/packages/9-eu-e-privacy-directive) for *Joomla!*.

The plugin (as part of the package) prompts website visitors to either accept or decline cookies.
The usage of cookies and likewise data storage methods (Local/SessionStorage) will be prohibited until the user accepts their usage.
In combination with the package this covers HTTP-Cookies, JavaScript-Cookies and those by third-party extensions and scripts.

This fork enables automatic switching between English and German based on the user's preferred content language.

Keep in mind that this is only the system plugin.
Richey Web offers a whole package containing the system plugin plus an AJAX plugin and a module.
